# EgoBlox

EgoBlox is a Telegram bot and USSD application that allows people to buy airtime, data, pay bills, and send tokens using Base names, Telegram usernames, and wallet addresses.

## Overview

### Inspiration:

The project was inspired by the need to make blockchain technology more accessible and useful in regions like Nigeria, where ISP bans and VPN restrictions block access to smart wallets. Additionally, thereâ€™s a gap in enabling seamless, onchain transactions for essential services like airtime, data, and utility bill payments, making it difficult for people to leverage crypto for daily needs. We set out to solve these challenges with a solution that brings real-world use cases to the onchain economy.

### What it Does:

- Enables users to buy airtime, data, and pay utility bills directly through a Telegram bot.
- Allows seamless token transfers using Base names, Telegram usernames, or wallet addresses.
- Implements smart accounts for gasless transactions, bypassing ISP bans and VPN restrictions that typically block access to smart wallets.
- Provides a user-friendly, onchain solution for essential daily services, making blockchain technology accessible to everyone.

## Tech Stack

- **Blockchain**: Base network
- **Backend**: Node.js, TypeScript
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Telegram API**: For bot functionality

## Key Features

- **Utility Payments**: Buy airtime, data, and pay for electricity and other bills.
- **Token Transfers**: Send tokens easily via Base names, Telegram usernames, or wallet addresses.
- **Smart Accounts**: Implemented for gasless transactions, overcoming ISP bans and VPN issues.

## Challenges Overcome

- **Smart Wallet Restrictions**: Bypassed ISP and VPN restrictions by abstracting smart wallets into smart accounts.
- **Gas Payments**: Enabled seamless gasless transactions for users with our Paymaster integration.

## What's Next?

- Expand utility services to other countries.
- Integrate more tokens and cross-chain capabilities.
- Build crypto off-ramping options.
